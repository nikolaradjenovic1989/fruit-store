# The Fruit Store

This application will allow a user to view fruits in the Fruit Store. User can view lists of:

- Hot Products

- New Products

- Recommended Products

- All Products

User is also able to add and delete the fruits at any time.

## Example

1. click the load button to load all the information of the fruit list below first. Please note: the tab "All" should include all the information of other three tabs.

2. click the add button to add a new fruit. After adding, please click the load button again to update the information of the fruit list, and you'll see the new fruit added in the corresponding tab.

3. click the delete button to delete an existing fruit. After deleting, please click the load button again to update the information of the fruit list, and you'll see the fruit removed from the corresponding tab.
